--This format is what we call a self-describing data format, because each piece of data has attached to it a
--short description of its meaning. Self-describing data are more readable (by humans, at least) than CSV
--or other compact notations; they are easy to edit by hand, when necessary; and they allow us to make
--small modifications in the basic format without having to change the data file. For instance, if we add a
--new field we need only a small change in the reading program, so that it supplies a default value when
--the field is absent.
